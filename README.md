# Pac-Man
This is my version of the PacMan Factory exercise from MIT xPro course.

To run simply drag the extracted folder from the ZIP file into your editor and run locally.

First button on the top left deploys a PacMan Ghost, while the the second button turns them into blue ghost that pacman collects for points!

Very fun project. Would love to add more features in the near future like damage points if you colid with a color ghost like in the original game.
